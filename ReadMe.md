# Yaml-Checker

## Check your Yaml files with GitHub Actions!
This GitHub action automatically checks your code for errors in YAML files when
a pull request comes or the code is pushed. 
This tool uses yamllint and was made
for the "GitHub Actions Hackathon"

But because GitHub includes yamllint by default in GitHub Actions virtual
enviroments, this tool isn't useful anymore
